# --- note ---
#  o365 won't allow sending emails using aliases. And, for that matter,
#  it's being a PITA with mutt. Therefore, rely instead on imap.suse.de, which
#  is running a decent smtp server.
#
#  In the words of lars, we changed a good email server with bad calendaring,
#  for a mediocre email server with good calendaring.
