This directory contains the installation files from 'mutt-wizard', which can be found at

   https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard.git

We use it quite a bit, and we have even moved around a few files to fit our setup,
but credit where credit is due, and this has made our life SOOO much easier...
